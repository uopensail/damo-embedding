In addition, most small companies do not need distributed training when training machine learning/deep learning models. On the one hand, because small companies do not have enough data to train distributed large models. On the other hand, training distributed model is a relatively complex project, with high requirements for engineers, and the cost of machines is also high. However, if stand-alone training is used, Out-Of-Memory (OOM) and Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) problems often arise. Damo-Embedding is a project designed to solve these problems.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"modules/CBF":{"id":"modules/CBF","title":"Counting Bloom Filter","description":"Why Counting Bloom Filter","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"modules/Embedding":{"id":"modules/Embedding","title":"Embedding","description":"The Embedding module uses Rocksdb to store the values of Embedding, which is KV format.
